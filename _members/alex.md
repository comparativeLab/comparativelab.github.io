I am Alex Chan, a current PhD student in the lab. I am a computational biologist/ behavioural ecologist interested in using machine learning and computer vision techniques to help us study fine scaled animal behaivour.

In my PhD, I aim to develop a pipeline to reconstruct 3D postures of bird flocks using machine learning and computer vision methods, starting with pigeons and potentially expanding to other bird species. Click the projects tab above to find out more!!

If you are a behavioural ecoloist looking to get into computer vision/ machine learning or computer scientists looking to track some animals, do reach out!
