<div id ="intro">
I am a postdoctoral researcher broadly interested in social learning, social networks, animal culture and cultural evolution. I utilize both experimental and computational methods in my research. In particular, I focus on how social structure and processes impact cultural states. I am an interdisciplinary researcher, obtaining my BA in Politics from New York University, my MSc in the Evolution of Language and Cognition from The University of Edinburgh, and recently my PhD in Biology from Konstanz University via the IMPRS QBEE.
