Hi!
My name is Mathilde Delacoux and I'm coming from Belgium. I am a biologist, mainly interested in animal behavior and more particularly in individuality in behavior (namely, inter-individual differences in animal personalities and cognition).
During my PhD, I plan to investigate the role of these inter-individual differences during collective behaviors of pigeons in a collective foraging/predation context. For that, I am using a cutting-edge motion capture system that allows us to track precisely the pigeons' gaze and explore more deeply the birds' attention/interactions in the flock.
Aside from work, I'm a really curious and open person, and I love doing many different things, from drawing to hiking and climbing.
Do not hesitate to contact me if you're interested in my projects!
